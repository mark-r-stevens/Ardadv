/*
 * Arduino-serial
 * --------------
 * 
 * A simple command-line example program showing how a computer can
 * communicate with an Arduino board. Works on any POSIX system (Mac/Unix/PC) 
 *
 *
 * Compile with something like:
 * gcc -o arduino-serial arduino-serial.c
 *
 * Created 5 December 2006
 * Copyleft (c) 2006, Tod E. Kurt, tod@todbot.com

 *
 * 
 * Updated 8 December 2006: 
 *  Justin McBride discovered B14400 & B28800 aren't in Linux's termios.h.
 *  I've included his patch, but commented out for now.  One really needs a
 *  real make system when doing cross-platform C and I wanted to avoid that
 *  for this little program. Those baudrates aren't used much anyway. :)
 *
 * Updated 26 December 2007:
 *  Added ability to specify a delay (so you can wait for Arduino Diecimila)
 *  Added ability to send a binary byte number
 *
 * Update 31 August 2008:
 *  Added patch to clean up odd baudrates from Andy at hexapodia.org
